# Elliptic prime curve scripts
[info]: <> (Scripts inside this folder are for prime elliptic curves of the form y^2=x^3+ax^2+b [ecc-point]+++)
All scripts in this Folder are made for prime elliptic curves (`char>3`) of the following form:
$$y^{2}\equiv x^{3}+ax^{2}+b\quad[x,y]\in \mathbb{F}_{p}$$


or


$$F(X,Y)=Y^2-X^3-aX-b\qquad[x,y]\in\mathbb{F}_{1151}$$
