# Elliptic binary curve scripts
[info]: <> (Scripts inside this folder are for binary elliptic curves of the form y^2+xy=x^3+ax^2+b [ecc-point-char2]+++)
All scripts in this Folder are made for binary elliptic curves (`char=2`) of the following form:
$$y^{2}+xy\equiv x^{3}+ax+b\quad[x,y]\in \mathbb{F}_{2^{m}}$$
